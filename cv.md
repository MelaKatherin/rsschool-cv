### **About Myself:**
I'm a building engineer, but once realized that it’s not really mine. In my work I want more freedom and creativity. I know it’s difficult but I’m going to do my best to become a great front-end developer. I like to learn new things, new programs, more advanced methods. This is what the web interested me in, everything is constantly updated here, and you have to keep up with it. I try and I will try to become a good specialist!
